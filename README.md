# Loan Status Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project involved predicting the approval status of loan applications based on a dataset obtained from GitHub. The dataset contained 
information about previous applicants who applied for property loans.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project was to assist banks in making informed decisions on whether to approve a loan application. This decision is based on various factors such as:
- Applicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Previous Credit History
- Co-applicant Income

## Approach
To achieve the objective, I developed multiple machine learning models to analyze the provided data. 
The models were trained on historical data to predict the likelihood of loan approval for new applicants.

## Models Used
I experimented with several machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- KNN
- Linear Regression
  
## Results
The models were evaluated based on their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and R2 value. The best-performing model was Linear Regression, which achieved an accuracy of 85%.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrateed the potential of machine learning in automating the loan approval process, making it more efficient and reliable for banks and applicants.
